       "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, the user wants to know the best places in the US to see orcas. Let me start by recalling where orcas are commonly found in the US. The most famous spot is the Pacific Northwest, especially around Washington State and British Columbia. That's where the Southern Resident Killer Whales are, right? They feed on salmon and are often seen near the San Juan Islands. I should mention that area first.\\n\\nBut wait, there are different types of orcas, like the Transient and Resident populations. The Southern Residents are the ones that are more social and easier to spot. Maybe the user isn't aware of the different types, so explaining that briefly could add context.\\n\\nThen there's Northern Washington and Alaska. Alaska has a lot of orca activity too, especially in places like Prince William Sound and the Inside Passage. The Northern Residents there are similar to the Southern ones, but maybe they have different behaviors. Also, the Transients in Alaska might be more elusive since they hunt marine mammals. I should include both Resident and Transient pods here.\\n\\nCalifornia's coast is another possibility. I think there are orcas in California, but I'm not sure if they're the same as the Pacific Northwest ones. Maybe they travel down there seasonally? I should check that. Also, the California coast might have other whale species too, so it's worth mentioning but perhaps not the top spot.\\n\\nThe Atlantic coast is less known for orcas, but there are some sightings. The Gulf of Maine or the waters off Florida? I remember hearing about orcas in the Gulf of Mexico, but they're a different population, maybe more related to transient orcas. Are those the same as the Pacific ones? Maybe the user is interested in the more well-known populations, so focusing on the Pacific side makes sense.\\n\\nI should also consider the best times to visit. For the San Juans, spring to fall is prime time. Alaska's best season might be similar, maybe a bit longer due to the northern location. Weather and tour availability could be factors too. Maybe suggest specific tour companies that have good success rates.\\n\\nSafety and conservation are important. The Southern Residents are endangered, so it's good to mention responsible whale watching practices. Also, some populations are more protected than others, so highlighting that could be useful.\\n\\nWait, the user asked specifically about the US. So I should focus on US locations and maybe mention Canadian areas briefly if they're near the US. The user might not be aware that the best spots are in Canada, but they're in the US context. So maybe list the top US spots first and mention nearby Canadian ones if they're close.\\n\\nI should also think about other regions. For example, the Florida coast or the Gulf of Mexico? Are there orcas there? I think there's a small population in the Gulf, but they're more of a transient orca type. They might be more difficult to see, but it's worth mentioning for completeness.\\n\\nPutting it all together: the top spots would be the San Juan Islands, Alaska's Inside Passage, and maybe the Northern Washington coast. Then mention other areas like California and the Gulf. Provide details on each location, the types of orcas there, best times, and any tour recommendations. Also, add tips about tour operators, best practices, and conservation status to give a comprehensive answer.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe best places to see orcas (killer whales) in the **United States** are concentrated along the **Pacific Northwest coast**, where orcas are most abundant and regularly sighted. Here’s a breakdown of the top locations, along with tips for spotting them:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. San Juan Islands, Washington (Pacific Northwest)**\\n- **Why it’s great**: The **San Juan Islands** are part of the **Salish Sea** and home to the **Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKWs)**, a distinct population that feeds primarily on Chinook salmon. These orcas are highly social, acrobatic, and often approach boats.\\n- **Best time**: **April–October** (peak months: May–September, when salmon runs are strongest).\\n- **Where to spot them**:\\n  - **Friday Harbor** (main hub for whale-watching tours).\\n  - **Roche Harbor** or **Lighthouse Point** for scenic vantage points.\\n  - **Victoria, British Columbia** (just across the border) also offers excellent viewing.\\n- **Tour tips**:\\n  - Book with certified eco-tour operators like **San Juan Safaris** or **Washington Whale Watch**.\\n  - Keep a respectful distance (200 meters or more) to avoid disturbing the whales.\\n  - **Conservation note**: The SRKWs are endangered due to salmon shortages and pollution. Support conservation efforts when visiting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Alaska (Inside Passage & Prince William Sound)**\\n- **Why it’s great**: Alaska hosts **Northern Resident Killer Whales** (similar to SRKWs) and **Transient orcas** (which hunt marine mammals like seals and sea lions). The Inside Passage and Prince William Sound are prime areas.\\n- **Best time**: **May–September**.\\n- **Where to spot them**:\\n  - **Prince William Sound** (Glacier Bay National Park is a hotspot).\\n  - **Sitka** and **Juneau**: Often see orcas near fjords and inlets.\\n  - **Kenai Fjords National Park** (southcentral Alaska).\\n- **Tour tips**:\\n  - Book multi-day cruises or day trips with companies like **Alaska Whale Foundation** or **Kenai Fjords Tours**.\\n  - Transient orcas are quieter and more elusive than residents, so patience is key.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Northern Washington Coast (Olympic Peninsula)**\\n- **Why it’s great**: The **Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary** (near Neah Bay and La Push) is a hotspot for orcas, especially during spring and summer.\\n- **Best time**: **April–August**.\\n- **Where to spot them**:\\n  - **Neah Bay** and **La Push** (Hoh River area).\\n  - Whale-watching tours depart from **Port Angeles** and **Port Townsend**.\\n- **Bonus**: You might also see humpback whales, gray whales, and sea otters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. California Coast (Less Common but Possible)**\\n- **Why it’s great**: Orcas occasionally travel south along the California coast, particularly in the **northern part** (e.g., **Sonoma Coast** or **Northern Channel Islands**). These are typically **transient orcas** (marine mammal hunters) or **migrating pods**.\\n- **Best time**: **April–October**.\\n- **Where to spot them**:\\n  - **Bodega Bay** or **Point Reyes**.\\n  - Whale-watching tours from **San Francisco** or **Santa Cruz** may include orcas in summer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Gulf of Mexico (Rare, but Unique Population)**\\n- **Why it’s great**: The **Gulf of Mexico** has a small, genetically distinct population of orcas (likely transients). These are rare and not well-studied, but occasional sightings occur in the **Gulf Coast** (e.g., **Florida Panhandle** or **Louisiana**).\\n- **Best time**: **Year-round**, but sightings are sporadic.\\n- **Tour tips**: Join specialized dolphin/whale tours in the **Gulf Coast** for a chance to see these unique orcas.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Other U.S. Spots (Less Common)**\\n- **Pacific Northwest Rivers**: Some orcas follow salmon up rivers like the **Columbia River**, but these are rare and short-lived.\\n- **Northeast Coast**: Occasional orca sightings off **Maine** or **New England**, often linked to transient pods hunting seals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Pro Tips for Spotting Orcas**\\n1. **Book with certified eco-tour operators** (e.g., those certified by the **Orca Network** or **Washington State Department of Commerce**).\\n2. **Use apps** like **HappyWhale** to crowdsource recent sightings.\\n3. **Look for behaviors**: Orca breaches, spyhops (looking up from water), and the distinct white eye patches.\\n4. **Respect regulations**: Avoid getting too close, using loud motors, or feeding wildlife.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conservation Alert**\\n- The **Southern Resident Killer Whales** are critically endangered due to **salmon depletion**, **pollution**, and **ship noise**. Choose tours that follow **responsible whale-watching guidelines** (e.g., no drone use, reduced speed near pods).\\n- Support organizations like the **Center for Whale Research** or **Sea Shepherd** to help protect these iconic animals.\\n\\nLet me know if you’d like help planning a trip to any of these locations! 🐋\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1843, 'prompt_tokens': 67, 'total_tokens': 1910, 'completion_time': 5.916942447, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.00256354, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.04789774, 'total_time': 5.919505987}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c939a-c077-7b72-9e31-2fba37995362-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 67, 'output_tokens': 1843, 'total_tokens': 1910})"
