The capital infusion values Mistral at €10 billion, making it the most valuable AI company in Europe. ASML will likely gain a board seat and could integrate Mistral’s AI and analytics capabilities into its lithography tools to boost efficiency and development. This move marks a strategic step toward strengthening Europe’s technological sovereignty and reducing dependence on U.S. and Chinese AI ecosystems. Mistral, co-founded by AI veterans from DeepMind and Meta, is seen as a European rival to firms like OpenAI and Google.

Still, Samsung’s growth is constrained by U.S. export restrictions in China and competition from SK Hynix and Micron in advanced memory segments.

Delphi acts as a “store controller,” offering daily recommendations on procurement, pricing, assortment, and staffing. Early adopters have seen sales gains up to +2% and order cost reductions near 10%.
