We update our BTC to USD price in real-time. Bitcoin is up 5.39% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #1, with a live market cap of $1,327,300,200,248 USD. It has a circulating supply of 19,994,609 BTC coins and a max. supply of 21,000,000 BTC coins. [...] Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price was $0 when first introduced, and most Bitcoins were obtained via mining, which only required moderately powerful devices (e.g. PCs) and mining software. The first known Bitcoin commercial transaction occurred on May 22, 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz traded 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. At Bitcoin price today in mid-September 2021, those pizzas would be worth an astonishing $478 million. This event is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day.” In July 2010, Bitcoin first started trading, with the Bitcoin price ranging from $0.0008 to $0.08 at that time. [...] Thanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization that surpassed the $1 trillion mark in 2021, after Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $64,863.10 on April 14, 2021. This is owing in large part to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, and the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: wallets, exchanges, payment services, online games and more.\\n\\n### How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation?\", \"score\": 0.86331123}, {\"title\": \"Bitcoin (BTC) Price USD Today, News, Charts, Market Cap | Coinbase\", \"url\": \"https://www.coinbase.com/price/bitcoin\", \"content\": \"Source↗\\n\\n## Recent trends\\n\\nThe latest BTC price is $68,569.69. Compared to Bitcoin's value of $63,856.01 from 24 hours ago, there's been a 7% increase, while the current price is 3% up from $66,392.72 which was recorded one week ago. Bitcoin's all time high is $126,210.50, which was reached on October 6, 2025. This is a -46% change from its price today.\\n\\nThe current circulating supply of Bitcoin is 19,994,815. This is 95% of its max supply of 21,000,000 BTC and 100% of its total supply of 19,994,815. The market cap is currently $1.37T, which is a result of multiplying the current price of Bitcoin($68,569.69) by the total supply(19,994,815 BTC). The fully diluted valuation of Bitcoin is $1.43T. The diluted valuation of Bitcoin is $1.43T. [...] Bitcoin was first launched in January 2009 when its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, mined the genesis block (Block 0). The first documented exchange of Bitcoin for goods occurred on May 22, 2010, when 10,000 BTC were used to purchase two pizzas. This date is now known as Bitcoin Pizza Day.\\n\\nIn the years that followed, Bitcoin began trading on various exchanges, with its BTC/USD price starting at just a fraction of a cent. By February 2011, Bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar. Since then, its price has experienced significant rises and declines, reaching multiple all‑time highs, including above $122,000 in July 2025. The Bitcoin price today reflects a mix of global demand, adoption trends, and developments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. [...] The maximum supply of Bitcoin is 21 million BTC, a hard-coded limit in the Bitcoin protocol that cannot be changed without unanimous network consensus. This finite supply is one of Bitcoin’s defining features and a major reason it is compared to scarce resources like gold. As of now, around 20 million BTC have already been mined, leaving roughly 1 million BTC still to be created over the next century. This gradual issuance schedule is why many investors keep a close eye on the BTC price USD and track how scarcity might influence the Bitcoin price today in the future.\\n\\nWe update our Bitcoin to USD currency in real-time.
